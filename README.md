##Self-Assessment

####Functionality - 3
  I have an Enigma class with encrypt and decrypt methods (sucessfully implemented), as well as the encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces (also successfully implemented).

####Object Oriented Programming
  My project is broken into logical components with four classes with single responsibilities.
  There are only two methods (the encrypt_message and decrypt_message).
  No class is more than 100 lines.
  The variable and method names clearly communicate purpose. IE get_todays_date, encrypt_message.
