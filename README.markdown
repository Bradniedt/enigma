##Self-Assessment

####Functionality - 3
  I have an Enigma class with encrypt and decrypt methods (successfully implemented), as well as the encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces (also successfully implemented).

####Object Oriented Programming - 3
  My project is broken into logical components with four classes with single responsibilities.
  There are only two methods over 7 lines (they're 8 lines long - encrypt_message and decrypt_message).
  No class is more than 100 lines.
  The variable and method names clearly communicate purpose. IE get_todays_date, encrypt_message.

####Test Driven Development - 3
  All of my methods are tested in unit and integration tests. For example, any method that shifter has tested is also tested in enigma.
  My git history shows that I never wrote methods before writing a test.
  All of my tests show coverage of above 95%.

####Version Control - 3
  I have over 150 commits, 17 pull requests, and none of my commits include multiple methods.
